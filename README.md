# My Personal Neural Network Project 🧠

![Neural Network Banner](personal-neural-network-classifier)

This is my personal implementation of a neural network classifier as I learn about machine learning. 

## 🔒 Project Status
_Personal learning project_ - Not actively seeking contributions

## 🏗️ Current Focus
- Implementing basic neural network layers
- Experimenting with different activation functions
- Learning through practical implementation

## 📝 How I'm Using This
- As a reference for my own learning
- To track my progress in ML concepts
- To experiment with new ideas

## 👋 For Visitors
While this is my personal project, I'm happy if you find it useful for your own learning! Please respect this as my personal learning space.
